Wiring is simple.

5v should be taken from a regulated source on your host machine and connected to 5v in on the ATTiny85 board.
GND should also be taken from GND on your machine and connected to GND in on the ATTiny85 board.

The ATTiny85 and Si5351 should have their 5v and GND connections connected. This allows boath boards to power on simultaneaously.

The pin marked SDA on the Si5351 should be connected to the PB0 (Pin 5) connection on your ATTiny85 dev board.

The pin marked SCL on the Si5351 should be connected to the PB2 (Pin 7) connection on your ATTiny85 dev board.

The clock output connections will depend on your individual target projects.

Both the Si5351 and ATTiny85 boards used in this project will run safely off 5v.

QT Stemma wiring is shown in the Assembly_Images folder.

In my case, SDA was blue and connected to P0 with SCL being yellow and connected to P2.

Your cable harnesses may vary.
