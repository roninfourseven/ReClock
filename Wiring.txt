Wiring is simple.

5v should be taken from a regulated source on your host machine
GND should also be taken from GND on your machine.

The pin marked SDA on the Si5351 should be connected to the PB0 (Pin 5) connection on your ATTiny85 dev board.

The pin marked SCL on the Si5351 should be connected to the PB2 (Pin 7) connection on your ATTiny85 dev board.

The clock output connections will depend on your individual target projects.

Both the Si5351 and ATTiny85 boards used in this project will run safely off 5v.

QT Stemma wiring is shown in the Assembly_Images folder.

In my case, SDA was blue and connected to P0 with SCL being yellow and connected to P2.

Your cable harnesses may vary.
